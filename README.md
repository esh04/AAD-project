# AAD-project
A Concept map of various algorithms in the form of a website containing mini games as well as additional information and linked references. 

The algorithms for the games were coded in `Python` and the website was developed using `Flask`.

### To run the app locally: 
`python3 app.py`

### Contents
- The website consists of three mini games namely,
  - **N Queens**: A classic Backtracking problem where one must place N queens on an NxN board such that no two queens can attack each other.
  - **Three Partitions**: A Dynamic Programming problem where we must partition the set of given numbers into three such that sum of the numbers in each partition is equal.
  - **Santas Smelling Socks**: A Divide and Conquer problem where one must identify a randomly chosen sock based on the given inputs.
- Hints as well as some additional resources are provided in all the games.
 - Apart from the games, the site also has pages that give a brief description about the following topics and also provide addition references to the same:
    1. Backtracking
    2. Dynamic Programming
    3. Greedy Algorithm
    4. Divide and Conquer
    5. Randomized Algorithm
    6. Sorting Algorithms
    7. Searching Algorithms
    8. Branch and Bound Algorithm
    9. Pattern Searching
    10. Bitwise Algorithms
